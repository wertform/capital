First Book. The Production Process of Capital.

Chapter One. Commodity and Money.

1) The Commodity.

The wealth of societies in which capitalistic mode of production prevails appears as an “immense collection of commodities”, [^a1] and the single commodity as its *elementary form*. Our investigation therefore begins with the analysis of the commodity.

The commodity is, first of all, an outer object, a thing that, through its properties, meets human needs of some type. The nature of these needs, whether they arise from the stomach or the imagination, for example, alters nothing in the case.[^a2] Nor is it a question here, how the thing meets the human need, whether immediately as a means of life, i.e. as an object of consumption (*Genusses*), or by a detour, as a means of production.

Every useful thing, such as iron, paper, etc., is to be considered under a double aspect: according to *quality* and according to *quantity*. Each such thing is a whole of many properties and can therefore be of use in different respects. To discover these different respects and thus the manifold modes of use of the thing is an historical act. [^a3] So is the discovery of social *measures* for the *quantity* of useful things. The diversity among measures among commodities arises partly from the different nature of the objects to be measured and in part from convention.

The usefulness of a thing for human life gives it *use value*. [^a4]  The useful thing itself, or the *commodity-body* -  iron, wheat, diamond, etc. - we call for short a *use value*, good, article. When treating of use values, quantitative determinateness is always given, as e.g. a *dozen* watches, a *yard* of linen, a *ton* of iron, etc. The use values of commodities provide the material for a special discipline, *commodity knowledge* (*Warenkunde*).[^a5] The use value is only actualized in use or consumption. Use values form the *material content of wealth*, whatever its *social form*. In the form of society we are considering, they also form the material bearers of -- *exchange value*.

Exchange value appears first as the *quantitative relation,* the proportion  in which use values of one kind exchange with use values of another kind, [^a6] a *relation* that constantly changes with time and place. Exchange value thus seems to be something contingent and purely *relative*; an inward, immanent exchange value of a commodity (*valeur intrinsèque*) thus also seems a *contradictio in adjecto*. [^a7] Let us take a closer look.

A single commodity - a quarter of wheat, for example - exchanges in the *most diverse proportions* with other articles. Nevertheless, its exchange value remains *unchanged*, whether expressed in x boot polish, y silk, z gold, etc. It must therefore be something distinguishable from these, its different *modes of expression*.

Take, again, two commodities, e.g. wheat and iron. Whatever their exchange relation, it is always possible to express it in an equality, wherein a given quantum of wheat is equated with some quantum of iron, e. g., 1 quarter wheat = a hundredweight iron. What does this equality say? That *the same value* exists in *two different things*, in 1 quarter of wheat and also in a hundredweight of iron. Both are therefore equal to a *third*, which in and for itself is neither the one nor the other. Each of the two, insofar as it is exchange value, must therefore be reducible to this third thing, independently of the other.

A simple geometric example illustrates this. In order to determine and compare the area of all rectilinear figures, they are broken down into triangles. The triangle itself is reduced to an expression that is quite different from its visible figure – half the product of its base line and its height. Similarly, the exchange values of commodities are to be reduced to something *common* (ein *Gemeinsames*) of which they present more or less.

The exchange relation shows that the substance of exchange value is quite different from, and independent of, the commodity's physical and tangible existence or its being as *use value*. It is characterized precisely by  *abstraction from use value*. Considered as exchange value, one commodity is just as good as any other, if only it is available in the right proportion. [^a8]

Regardless of their exchange relation or the *form* under which they *appear* as *exchange* values, commodities are therefore to be considered first and foremost as *values* simpliciter. [^a9]

As objects of use or goods, commodities are *corporeally different* things. Their value, on the other hand, forms their *unity*. This unity does not spring from nature, but from society. The *communal social substance* that is only presented differently in different use values is — *labor*.

As *values*, commodities are nothing but *crystallized labor*. The unit of measure of labor itself is *simple average labor*, the character of which admittedly changes in different countries and cultural epochs, but is given in an existing society. More complicated labor is only considered as a *potentiated* or rather *multiplied* simple labor, so that, for example, a smaller quantum of complicated labor equals a larger quantum of simple labor. *How* this reduction is regulated is irrelevant here. *That* it is constantly taking place is shown by experience. A commodity may be the product of the most complicated labor. Its *value* equates it with the product of simple labor and thus presents itself merely as a determinate quantum of simple labor.

A use value or good has *value* only because labor is *objectified* or *materialized* in it. How is the *magnitude* of its value measured? By the *quantum* of the “value-forming substance”, labor, put into it (*in ihm enthaltenen*). The quantity of labor is itself measured in terms of its *duration* -- and *labor time* finds its measure in *determinate periods of time*, such as hours, days, etc.

It might seem that, if the value of a commodity is determined by the quantum of labor expended in its production, it would follow that the more lazy or unskillful a man is, the more valuable his commodity would be, because he needs more labor time to produce it. But only *socially necessary labor time* counts as value-forming. Socially necessary labor time is the labor time required to produce a given use value under present socially normal production conditions and with the socially average degree of skill and intensity of labor. After the introduction of the steam loom in England, for example, it took perhaps half as much labor as before to transform a given quantum of yarn into cloth. The English hand weaver still needed the same labor time for this transformation, but the product of his individual hour of labor now presented only half a social hour of labor and accordingly dropped to half its former value. 

What determines the *magnitude* of value is therefore just the *quantum of socially necessary labor*, or the *labor time socially necessary for the production of a use value*. The single commodity is here regarded as the average specimen of its kind.[^a10] Commodities into which equally great quanta of labor are put, or which can be produced *in the same labor time*, therefore have *the same value magnitude*. The value of a commodity stands in the same relation to the value of every other commodity as the labor time necessary for the production of the one stands to the labor time necessary for the production of the other. “As values, all commodities are merely determinate masses of *congealed labor time*”[^a11].

The *value magnitude* of a commodity would therefore remain constant if the labor time required for its production were constant. However, the latter changes with every change in the *productive power of labor*. The productive power of labor is determined by manifold circumstances, including the average degree of skill among the workers, the stage of development of science and its technological applicability, social combination within the production process, the range and effectivity of the means of production, and by *natural relations*. The same quantum of labor, for example, may yield 8 bushels of wheat during a favorable season and only 4 during an unfavorable one. The same quantum of labor provides more metal in rich mines than in poor ones, etc. Diamonds occur rarely in the earth's crust and, *on average*, their discovery costs a lot of labor time. Consequently, they present a lot of labor in a small volume. *Jacob* doubts that the full value of gold has ever been paid. This holds still more for diamonds. According to *Eschwege*, in 1823 the total eighty-year yield of the Brazilian diamond mines had not yet reached the value of the 1½ year average product of the Brazilian sugar or coffee plantations. With richer mines, the same labor-quantum would present itself in more diamonds and their value would sink. Were one to succeed in transforming coal, with little labor, into diamonds, then their value might fall below that of bricks. In general: the greater the productive power of labor, the less the labor time required to produce an article, the less the mass of labor crystallized in it, and the less its value. Conversely, the smaller the productive power of labor, the greater the labor time necessary for the production of an article and the greater its value. The *value magnitude* of a commodity thus changes *directly* as the quantum and *inversely* as the *productive power* of labor that actualizes itself in it.

We now know the *substance* of value. It is *labor*. We know the measure of its magnitude. It is *labor time*. Its *form* - which stamps *value* precisely as *exchange* value - remains to be analyzed. Before that, however, we must be develop  a bit more the determinations already found. 

A thing can be *use value* without being *exchange value*. This is the case when its presence for human beings is not mediated by labor. Thus air, virgin soil, natural meadows, wild-growing wood, etc. A thing can be useful and the product of human labor without being a *commodity*. Whoever satisfies their own need through their product, creates *use value*, but not *commodity*. To produce a commodity, they must not only produce use value, but *use value for others*, *social use value*. Finally, no thing can be *value* without being an object of use. If it is useless, then the labor put into it (*in ihm enthaltene*) is also useless; it does not count as labor and therefore forms no value.

Originally, the *commodity* appeared to us as something *double-sided*, as use value and exchange value. A closer look will show that *the labor put into the commodity is also double-sided*. This point, which I first developed critically,[^a12] is the crux around which the understanding of political economy revolves.

Let us take two commodities, for example, a coat and 10 yards of linen. The former has double the value of the latter, so that if 10 yards of linen = W, the coat = 2 W.

The coat is a use value that satisfies a particular need. To produce it, a *determinate type of purposeful productive activity* is required. The activity is determined by purpose, mode of operation, object, means and result. For the sake of simplicity, the labor whose usefulness is thus presented in the use value of its product, or in the fact that its product is a use value, is called *useful labor* for short. Under this aspect, it is always considered in relation to the *useful effect* at which the production aims.

Just as coats and linen are *qualitatively different use values*, so the labors that mediate their being are *qualitatively different* – *tailoring* and *weaving*. If these use values were not qualitatively different and therefore products of qualitatively different useful labors, they could not confront each other at all as commodities. A coat does not exchange itself for a coat, nor one use value for the same use value.

In the totality of various kinds of use values or commodity-bodies, there appears a similarly manifold totality of different useful labors, distinguished according to genus, species, family, subspecies, variety — a *social division of labor*. This is a condition of existence for the production of commodities, although the production of commodities is not, conversely, a condition of existence for a social division of labor. In the ancient Indian community, labor is socially divided, without the *products* becoming *commodities*. Or, to take a nearer example, labor is systematically divided in every factory, but this division is not mediated by the workers exchanging their individual products. Only the products of self-standing and *mutually independent private labors* confront each other as commodities.

We have thus seen:  the use value of each commodity contains a determinate purposeful, productive activity or useful labor. Use values cannot confront each other as *commodities* unless qualitatively different useful labors reside in them. In a society whose products *universally* take the form of *commodities*, that is, in a society of commodity producers, this qualitative difference between useful labors - which are carried out independently of each other as the private business of self-standing producers - develops into a multi-faceted system, a social division of labor.

For a coat it is all the same whether it is worn by the tailor or by the tailor's customer. In both cases it operates as use value. Similarly, the relationship between the coat and the labor that produces it is not changed in and for itself by the fact that tailoring has become a profession, a self-standing member of the social division of labor. Whenever the need for clothing compelled him, the human being had been tailoring for thousands of years before any human being became a tailor. But the presence of coats, linen, and every element of *material wealth* that is not naturally available, has to be mediated by a specific purposive productive activity that assimilates particular natural substances to particular human needs. Labor as what forms use values, as *useful labor*, is therefore a condition of existence of human beings independent of all social forms, an eternal natural necessity mediating the metabolism between human beings and nature, and so mediating human life.

The use values coat, linen, etc. - in short, the commodity-bodies - are *composites of two elements*, natural material and labor. If one subtracts the sum total of all the various useful labors that go into a coat, linen, etc., what always remains is a material substrate that is available in nature without the intervention of human beings. In his production, the human being can only proceed as nature itself does, that is, only by *altering the form of the material*.[^a13] Even more: he is constantly supported by natural forces in this labor of formation itself. *Labor* is thus *not the only source of the use values it produces*, of *material wealth*. Labor is its father, as *William Petty* says, and the earth its mother.

Let us now move on from the commodity as object of use, to commodity value.

According to our assumption, the coat has double the value of the linen. However, this is only a *quantitative* difference, which is of no interest to us at the moment. We therefore remember that if the value of a coat is twice as great as that of 10 yards of linen, 20 yards of linen have *the same magnitude of value* as a coat.

As values, a coat and linen are things of the *same substance*, objective expressions of *homogeneous (gleichartig) labor*. But *tailoring* and *weaving* are qualitatively different labors. However, there are social conditions in which *the same human being* alternately tailors and weaves, and these two different modes of labor are therefore only *modifications of the labor of the same individual* and not yet particular, fixed functions of different individuals, just as the coat that our tailor makes today and the trousers that he makes tomorrow only presuppose variations of the same individual labor. The evidence of the senses tells us moreover that in our capitalist society, depending on the changing direction of the demand for labor, *a given portion of human labor* is alternately supplied in the form of tailoring or weaving. This change of form of labor may not take place without friction, but it must take place. If we disregard the determinateness of the productive activity and therefore the useful character of the labor, what remains of it is that it is an *expenditure of human labor-power*. Tailoring and weaving, although qualitatively different productive activities, are both productive expenditures of human brain, muscle, nerve, hand, etc., and in this sense both are human labor. They are only two different forms of expenditure of human labor-power. 

Of course, human labor-power itself must be more or less developed in order to be expended in this or that form. The value of commodities, however, presents human labor as such, the expenditure of human labor-power in general. Now, just as in bourgeois society a general or a banker plays a great role, while the human being in the first instance plays a very modest one[^a14], so it is here with *human labor*. It is the expenditure of *simple* labor-power, which every ordinary human being, without any particular development, possesses in his bodily organism. 

The labor-power of a farm laborer, for example, figures as simple labor-power, and its expenditure as *simple labor*, or *human labor* without further embellishment; tailoring labor, on the other hand, figures as expenditure of more highly developed labor power. While the workday of the farm laborer is presented in a *value-expression* of, say, ½ W, the workday of the tailor, on the other hand, might be presented in a value-expression of W.[^a15] However, this difference is only *quantitative*. If the coat is the product of a day's labor of the tailor, it has the same value as the product of two days' labor of the farm laborer. But the tailor's labor always counts only as *multiplied* farm labor. The different proportions, in which the different types of labor are reduced to simple labor as their unit of measurement, are determined by a social process behind the backs of the producers and therefore appear to them to be given by tradition. For the sake of simplicity, in the following, any type of labor-power is taken immediately for simple labor-power, whereby only the effort of reduction is spared.

Just as in the *values* of the coat and the linen, the difference between their *use values* is abstracted, so too in the *labor* that these *values* present the difference in *useful forms* - the forms whereby they are *tailoring* on the one hand and *weaving* on the other - is also abstracted. Just as the *use values* of the coat and the linen are *combinations* of special-purpose productive activities with cloth and yarn, while the *values* of coat and linen are mere *congellations of homogeneous labor*, so also the labor put into these values figures not through its productive relation to cloth and yarn, but only as *expenditure of human labor-power*. Tailoring and weaving are formative elements of the *use values* coat and linen precisely because of their *different* qualities; they are the *substance* of the coat-*value* and the linen-*value* only to the extent that their particular quality *is abstracted*  and both possess the *same quality* - the quality: *human labor*.

Coats and linen are not only *values in general*, but values of a *determinate magnitude*, and, as we have assumed, a coat is worth twice as much as 10 yards of linen. Why this difference in their *value magnitude*? Because only half as much labor is put into the linen as into coat, labor-power must be expended for twice as much time to produce the latter as to produce the former.

Thus, if, with reference *use value*, the labor put into the commodity figures only *qualitatively*, with reference to *value magnitude*, it figures only quantitatively, having already been reduced to human labor without any further quality. There, the question is *how* and *what* the labor is, here it is *how much*, how long it takes. Since the value magnitude of a commodity merely measures the quantum of labor put into it, there must be some proportion in which two commodities are values of equal size.

If the productive power, that is to say, all the useful labor required for the production of a coat, remains unchanged, then the value magnitude of coats increases with their own quantity. If 1 coat x, 2 coats present 2 x workdays, etc. But suppose that the labor time necessary for the production of a coat doubles or halves. In the first case, one coat has the same value as two coats previously; in the latter case, two coats have only as much value as one previously, although in both cases a coat still provides the same service and the useful labor put into it is still of the same quality. But the *quantum* of labor expended in its production has changed.

A greater quantum of use value forms greater *material wealth* in and for itself: two coats are more than one. With two coats one can clothe two human beings, with one coat only one, etc. Nevertheless, an increased mass of material wealth can correspond to a simultaneous fall in its value. The possibility of such opposite movement arises from the *two-sided determination* of labor. Of course, productive power is always productive power of useful, concrete labor. It expresses only the degree of efficacy of purposive productive activity in a given span of time. Useful labor thus becomes a richer or poorer source of products in *direct proportion* to the rise or fall of its productive power. On the other hand, a change in  productive power does not in and for itself affect the labor represented in *value*. Since productive power belongs to the concrete useful form of labor, it can of course no longer touch labor where its concrete useful form is abstracted. The same labor in *the same span of time* therefore always presents itself in the same *value magnitude*, however much the productive power changes. But it provides *different quanta of use values in the same span of time* - more when the productive power increases, and less when it decreases. In the former case, it may happen that less labor is put into two coats than formerly went into one. The same change in productive power, which increases the fruitfulness of labor and thus the mass of use values it provides, can also reduce the *value magnitude* of this *increased* total mass, namely if it shortens the *labor time* necessary for its production. The reverse is also true.

From what has been said so far, it follows that although there are not two different types of labor in the commodity, *the same* labor is determined differently and even in opposite ways, depending on whether it is related to the *use value* of the commodity, as its *product*, or to the *commodity value*, as its merely objective expression. Just as the commodity must above all be an object of use in order to be value, so labor must above all be useful labor, purposive productive activity, in order to count as *expenditure of human labor-power* and therefore as *human labor* simpliciter.

Since so far only value-substance and value-magnitude have been determined, we now turn to the analysis of *value-form*.

First, let us return to the first *form of appearance* of commodity-*value*.

We take two quanta of commodities that cost *the same amount of labor time* to produce, and thus are *equal value magnitudes*, and we have *40 yards of linen = 2 coats*, or 40 yards of linen are *worth* two coats. We see that the *value* of the linen is expressed in a determinate quantity of *coats*. 

The *value* of a commodity, thus presented in the use value of another commodity, is called its *relative value*.

The relative value of a commodity can change, although its value remains constant. Conversely, its relative value can remain constant, although its value changes. The equality *40 yards of linen = 2 coats* affirms that both commodities cost the same amount of labor. However, with each change in the productive power of the labors that produce them, the labor time necessary for their production changes. Let us consider the influence of such changes on relative value.

I\. The value of the linen  varies, while the coat-*value* remains constant. The value of the linen doubles if the labor time expended for its production doubles - for example as a result of the incresasing infertility of the flax fields. Instead of 40 yards of linen = 2 coats, we would then have: *40 yards of linen = 4 coats*, since 2 coats now contain only half as much labor time as 40 yards of linen. The value of the linen decreases by half, on the other hand, if the labor time necessary for its production of the linen decreases by half - for example as a result of improved looms. Accordingly, now: *40 yards of linen = 1 coat*. The *relative value* of commodity A, i.e., its value expressed in terms of commodity B, thus *rises and falls* in *direct proportion* with the value of commodity A, when the value of commodity B remains constant.

II\. Let the value of the linen remain constant, but the coat-*value* varies. If under these circumstances the labor time necessary for the production of the coat doubles - e.g. as a result of a bad wool-shearing season - then instead of 40 yards of linen = 2 coats we now have: *40 yards of linen = 1 coat*. If, on the other hand, the value of the coat falls by half, then *40 yards of linen = 4 coats*. If the value of commodity A remains the same, its relative value, expressed in commodity B, falls or rises in *inverse proportion to the change in the value of B.*

If we compare the different cases I and II, it can be seen that *the same change in relative value can arise from completely opposite causes.* Thus, from *40 yards of linen = 2 coats*, 1) the equality *40 yards of linen = 4 coats* may arise either because the value of the linen doubles or the value of the coats falls by half, and 2) the equality *40 yards of linen = 1 coat* may arise either because the value of the linen falls by half or the value of the coat rises to double.

III\. The labor-quanta necessary for the production of linen and coats change simultaneously, in the same direction and in the same proportion. In this case, we still have *40 yards of linen = 2 coats*, however their values change. We discover their change in value as soon as we compare them with a third commodity whose value remains constant. If the values of *all* commodities rose or fell simultaneously and in the same proportion, their *relative values* would remain unchanged. Their actual change in value would be seen from the fact that,in general, a greater or smaller quantum of commodities than before would now be provided in the same labor period.

IV\. The labor times necessary for the production of linen and coats, and therefore their values, may change simultaneously in the same direction, but to unequal degrees, or in opposite directions, etc. The influence of all possible such combinations on the relative value of a commodity is simply derived by applying Cases I., II., and III.

We have just examined how far changes in the *relative magnitude of the value* of a commodity, linen, reflect a change in its *own value magnitude*, and have only considered the *relative value* under its *quantitative* aspect. We now turn to its *form*. If relative value is the *presentation-form of value*, then the expression of the equivalence of *two* commodities, such as x commodity A = y commodity B or 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, is *the simple form of relative value*.

*I. First or simple form of relative value: 20 yards of linen = 1 coat. (x commodity A = y commodity B)*

This form is somewhat difficult to analyze because it is *simple*.[^a16] The determinations distinguished in it are veiled, undeveloped, abstract, and therefore can be separated and held fast only with some effort of the power of abstraction. But this much is evident at first glance: that the *form* remains the same whether it be 20 yards of linen = 1 coat or 20 yards of linen = x coats. [^a17]

Linen comes into the world in the form of a *use value* or useful thing. Its stiff-linen bodiliness or *natural form* is therefore not its *value form*, but rather its exact opposite. It first shows its own proper *value-being* through *another* commodity, *relating* itself to the coat as *its [the linen's] equal*. If linen were not itself value, it could not relate itself to the coat as value, as *its equal*. It sets itself equal to the coat *qualitatively* by relating itself to it as *objectification of homogeneous human labor, i.e., as of its own value substance*. It sets itself equal to just one coat instead of x coats because it is not only value in general, but value of a *determinate magnitude*, and one coat contains just *as much* labor as 20 yards of linen. By thus relating to the coat, the linen strikes several flies with one swat. Since the *other* commodity is something it *equates with itself as value*, it thereby *relates itself to itself as value.* By relating itself to itself as *value*, it simultaneously *distinguishes* itself *from itself as use value.* By expressing its value magnitude – and value magnitude is both value in general and quantitatively measured value – in terms of the coat, it gives its value-being a value-form that is distinct from its immediate existence. By presenting itself as something differentiated within itself, it presents itself as actually a commodity for the first time – a useful thing that is also value. Insofar as the linen has use value, it is a self-standing thing. Its *value*, on the other hand, *appears* only in relation to other commodities, a coat, for example. This is a relation in which the commodity-kind coat is equated with it qualitatively and therefore counts equally *in a determinate quantity*, replacing it and being exchangeable with it. Value therefore maintains its own proper form, distinct from use value, only through its presentation as *exchange value*.

The expression of the linen-*value* in coat imposes a new form on the coat itself. In fact, what does the *value form* of the linen say? That the coat is exchangeable with it. As it walks or lies, with skin and hair, *in its natural form* coat, it now has the form *immediate exchangeability with other commodities*, the form of exchangeable use value or *equivalent*. The determination 'equivalent' contains not only that a commodity is *value* simpliciter, but that, in its thingly shape, in its use form, it figures for *other commodities as value*, and so is there *as exchange value* immediately for the other commodity.

As *value*, the linen consists *only* of labor, forming a transparent crystallized labor-congelation. In actuality, however, this crystal is very opaque. Insofar as labor can be discovered in a commodity -- and not every commodity-body shows the trace of labor -- it is not undifferentiated human labor, but weaving, spinning, etc.; and these by no means form its only substance, but are rather entwined (*verquickt*) with natural materials (*Naturstoffen*). To hold fast to linen as a mere thingly (*dinglich*) expression of human labor, one must ignore everything that actually makes it a thing (*Ding*). The objectivity (*Gegenständlichkeit*) of the human labor that is itself abstract, without further quality and content, is necessarily abstract objectivity -- a *thought-thing* (*Gedankending*). Thus, a flax weaving (*Flachsgewebe*, the woven flax) becomes a brain spinning (*Hirngespinnst*, sc. 'figment of the imagination'). But *commodities* are *things* (*Sachen*). Whatever they are, they must be thing-ly (*sachlich*) or show their own thing-ly relationships. In the production of linen, a determinate quantum of human labor-power has been expended. Linen's value is the merely *objective reflection* (*gegenständliche Reflex*) of the labor thus expended, but it is not reflected in the linen's own body. It *reveals* itself, attains sensuous expression, through its *value-relation* to the coat. It is by the linen's equating itself with the coat as *value*, while at the same time *distinguishing* itself from it as *object of use* (*Gebrauchgegenstand*), that the coat becomes the *form of appearance* of the linen-*value* in opposition to the linen-body - its value form in distinction from its natural form. [^a18]

In the relative expression of value: 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, or: x yards of linen are y coat's-*worth*, the coat figures only *as value*, or labor-congelation, but it is precisely thereby that congealed labor figures *as coat*, and coat as the form in which human labor congeals.[^a18a] The use value **coat** only becomes a form of appearance of linen-value, because linen relates to the coat-material as *immediate materialization of abstract human labor*, that is, labor homogeneous with that objectified in itself. The object **coat** figures for it as sensuously tangible objectivity of homogeneous human labor, and thus as value in natural form. Since linen is, as value, the same in being with the coat, the natural form **coat** thus becomes the form of appearance of linen's own value. But the labor manifested in the *use-value* **coat** is not human labor simpliciter, but a determinate, useful labor, tailoring labor. Human labor simpliciter, expenditure of human labor-power, admits any determination, but is not determinate in and for itself. It can only actualize itself, objectify itself, when human labor-power is expended in *determinate form*, as *determinate labor*, for only *determinate labor* that is confronted with a natural stuff (*Naturstoff*), an external material, in which it objectifies itself. Only the Hegelian “concept” manages to objectify itself without an external stuff.[^a19]

The linen cannot relate to the coat as value or *human labor incarnate* without relating to *tailoring* as the immediate *form of actualization of human labor*. What interests the linen about the use value **coat**, however, is neither its woollen coziness nor its buttoned-up essence nor any other useful quality that stamps it as use value. A coat serves only to present its value-objectivity in contrast to its stiff-linen object of useivity. It would have achieved the same purpose if it had expressed its value in assafoetida or poudrette or boot polish. Thus *tailoring* does not figure for it, insofar as it is special-purpose productive activity, useful labor, but only insofar as it is, as determinate labor, *form of actualization*, *mode of objectification of human labor in general*. If the linen expressed its value in boot polish instead of in a coat, then polish-ing instead of tailoring would be considered the immediate form of actualization of abstract human labor.[^a19a] A use value or commodity-body only becomes form of appearance of value or equivalent if another commodity refers to the concrete, useful kind of labor put into it as the immediate form of actualization of abstract human labor.

We are here at the crux of all the difficulties that hinder an understanding of the *value-form*. It is relatively easy to distinguish the value of the commodity from its use value, or the labor that forms the use value from the same labor, insofar as it is calculated merely as the expenditure of human labor-power in the value of the commodity. If you consider commodity or labor in the one form, you do not consider it in the other and vice versa. These abstract opposites fall apart by themselves and are therefore easy to keep apart. It is otherwise with the *value-form*, which exists only in the relation of commodity to commodity. The use value or commodity-body plays a new role here. It becomes the form of appearance of commodity *value*, and thus of its own opposite. Likewise, the concrete useful labor contained in the use value becomes its own opposite, the mere form of actualization of *abstract* human labor. Instead of falling apart from each other, the antithetical (*gegensätzlichen*) determinations of the commodity reflect each other here. As strange as this may seem at first glance, on closer reflection it proves to be necessary. The commodity is from the start a *two-edged* thing, use value *and* value, product of useful labor *and* congealed abstract labor. In order to present itself as what it is, it must therefore *double* its form. It possesses the form of a use value from nature. It is its natural form. It acquires its value form only in interaction with other commodities. But its value-form must itself be an *objective* form. The only objective forms of commodities are their use-shapes, their natural forms. 

Since now the natural form of a commodity, of linen, for example, is the direct opposite of its value form, it must take *another* natural form, the *natural form of another commodity*, as its value-form. What it cannot do immediately for itself, it can do immediately for another commodity and therefore, in a roundabout way, for itself. It cannot express its value in its own body or in its own use value, but it can relate itself to another use value or commodity-body as immediate value-existence. It cannot relate itself to the concrete labor put into itself, but it can relate itself to the concrete labor put into another kind of commodity as mere form of actualization of abstract human labor. To do so, it need only equate the other commodity with itself as *equivalent*. The use value of a commodity exists generally only for another commodity, in so far as it serves in this way as the form of appearance of its value. If, in the simple relative value-expression: x commodity A = y commodity B, one considers only the *quantitative* relation, then one finds only the laws developed above concerning the movement of relative value, which are all based on the fact that the magnitude of value of commodities is determined by the labor time necessary for their production. But if we consider the *qualitative* aspect of the value-relation of the two commodities, we discover in that simple expression of value the secret of the value-form and hence, *in nuce*, of money.[^a20]

Our analysis has shown that *the relative value expression of a commodity includes two different value-forms*. Linen expresses its value and its *determinate value magnitude* in the coat. It presents its value in the *value relation* to another commodity, and thus as *exchange value*. On the other hand, the other commodity, the coat, in which it relatively expresses its value, attains precisely through this the form of a use value immediately exchangeable with it or its *equivalent*. Both forms - the relative value-form of the one commodity, equivalent form of the other - are forms of *exchange value*. Both are, in fact, only *moments*, mutually interdependent determinations, of *the same relative expression of value*, but distributed as poles across the two equated *commodity extremes*.

*Quantitative* determinacy is not included in the *equivalent form* of a commodity. For example, the determinate proportion in which **coat** is equivalent to **linen**, arises not from its equivalent form, *the form of its direct exchangeability* with the linen, but from the determination of the magnitude of value by labor time. The linen can only present its own value in coats, insofar as it relates itself to a determinate coat-quantum as a *given quantum* of crystallized human labor. If the coat-*value* changes, this relation also changes. But for the relative value of the linen to change, it must be present, and it can only be formed *on a given* coat-value. Whether now the linen presents its own value in 1, 2 or x coats depends, on this condition, entirely on the value magnitude of a yard of linen and the number of yards whose value is to be presented in coat-form. The value magnitude of a commodity is something it can only *express* in the use value of another commodity, as *relative value*. Conversely, a commodity only attains its form as an immediately exchangeable use value or *equivalent* as the *material in which* the value of another commodity is expressed.

This distinction is obscured by a characteristic peculiarity of the relative expression of value in its simple or first form. The equality: *20 yards of linen = 1 coat*, or 20 yards of linen are worth a coat, evidently includes the identical equality: *1 coat = 20 yards of linen*, or 1 coat is worth 20 yards of linen. The relative value-expression of the linen, in which the coat figures as equivalent, thus contains, *by a reference back* (*rückbezüglich*), the relative value-expression of the coat, in which the linen figures as equivalent.

Although both determinations of the *value-form* or both modes of presentation of the commodity *value* as *exchange value* are only *relative*, both do not *appear* to be relative to the same degree. In the *relative value* of the linen: 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, the *exchange value* of the linen is explicitly presented as *its relation to another commodity*. The coat, for its part, is only *equivalent,* insofar as the linen *relates* itself to it as a form of appearance of its own value and therefore as something directly exchangeable with it. It is only *within* this relation that it is it equivalent. But it behaves passively. It takes no initiative. It finds itself in relation because it is related to. The character that arises from its relation with the linen appears not as a result of *its relating*, but as if it were present without its help. Still more. The *determinate type and mode* in which the linen relates itself to the coat is fitted precisely to "do it" to the coat, however modest it may be and in no way the product of a “tailor run mad with pride”. The linen relates itself to the coat as sensuously existing materialization of human labor *in abstracto* and therefore as *present value body*. The coat only is this because and to the extent that the linen *relates* to it in this determinate way. Its *being as equivalent* is just a *determination of reflection* of the linen. But *it seems* just the opposite. On the one hand, it does not even bother to relate itself. On the other hand, the linen relates to the coat, not to make something of it, but because the coat is something apart from this.

The finished product of the the linen's relation to the coat, the coat's equivalent form, its determination as an immediately exchangeable use value, seems to belong to the coat *as thing* (*dinglich*), as something even *outside* the relation to the linen, in just the way it has its property of keeping warm. In the first or simple form of relative value: 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, this false semblance is *not yet fixed*, because it also immediately states the opposite, that the coat is the equivalent of the linen and that each of the two commodities possesses this determination only because and to the extent that the other renders it its relative value-expression. [^a21]

In the simple form of relative value, or the expression of the equivalence of *two* commodities, the development of the form of value is *identical* for both commodities, though in each case in the *opposite* orientation. The *relative value-expression* is, with respect to each of the two commodities, furthermore *uniform*; for the linen presents its value only in *one* commodity, the coat, and vice versa, but for the *two* commodities the value-expression is *two*, different for each. Finally, each of the two commodities is only *equivalent* for the other individual commodity type and thus only *a singular equivalent*.

Such an equality as *20 yards of linen = 1 coat*, or twenty yards of linen *are worth* one coat, evidently expresses the value of the commodity only in a very limited and one-sided way.  If, for example, I compare the linen with other commodities instead of coats, I then obtain *other relative value-expressions*, other *equalities*, such as 20 yards of linen = u coffee, 20 yards of linen = v tea, etc. Linen has *just as many different relative value-expressions* as there are different commodities of its kind, and the number of its relative value-expressions constantly grows with the number of newly emerging commodity types.[^a22]

The first form, *20 yards of linen = 1 coat*, yielded two relative expressions, for the value of *two* commodities. This second form gives the most colorful mosaic of relative expressions for *the value of the same commodity*. It does not seems that anything has also been gained as regards the expression of the *magnitude* of value, for in *20 yards of linen = 1 coat* the *magnitude of value* of the linen, which remains the same in each expression, is  presented just as exhaustively as in 20 yards of linen = tea, etc., nor for the  form-determination of the equivalent, for in 20 yards of linen = u coffee, etc., coffee, etc., are only *singular equivalents*, just as it was with the coat.

Nevertheless, this second form contains an essential further development. For it is not only that the linen expresses its value by chance now in coats, now in coffee, etc., but that it expresses it *both* in coats and in coffee, etc., *either* in *this* commodity *or* in that *or* in the third, etc. The further determination shows itself as soon as this second or *unfolded form of the relative value-expression* is presented in its context. We then obtain:

### II. Second or unfolded form of relative value:

*20 yards of linen = 1 coat or = u coffee or = v tea or = x iron or = y wheat or = etc.*

*z commodity A = u commodity B or = v commodity C or = w commodity D or = x commodity E or = y commodity F or = etc.*

At first, the first form obviously constitutes the *basic element* of the second form, because the latter consists of many simple relative value-expressions, such as 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, 20 yards of linen = u coffee, etc.

In the first form: *20 yards of linen = 1 coat*, it may seem an accidental fact that these two commodities are exchangeable in *this determinate quantitative proportion*. In the second form, by contrast, a background shines through straightaway that is essentially different from the accidental appearance and determines it.  The value of the linen remains the same in magnitude whether it is presented in the form of coat, coffee, iron, etc., in countless different commodities, belonging to the most diverse possessors. The accidental relation between two individual possessors of commodities falls away. It becomes clear that it is not exchange that regulates the magnitude of the value of the commodity, but rather the other way around: the value of the commodity regulates its exchange relations.

In the expression: *20 yards of linen = 1 coat*, the coat was considered a form of appearance of the labor objectified *in the linen*. Thus, the labor put into the linen was equated to the labor put into the coat and therefore determined as homogeneous *human* labor. However, this determination did not emerge *expressly*. The first form immediately equates the labor put into the linen only with tailoring labor. The second form is different. In the endless, always extendable series of its relative value-expressions, the linen refers to all possible commodity-bodies as mere forms of appearance of the labor put into it itself. Thus it is first here that linen-*value* is truly presented as *value*, i.e., *crystal of human labor in general*.

The second form consists of a *sum* of equalities of the first form. Each of these equalities, like as *20 yards of linen = 1 coat*, also includes the reverse relation: *1 coat = 20 yards of linen*, where the coat presents its value in the linen and, precisely thereby, presents the linen as an equivalent. Since this is true for each of the countless relative value-expressions of the linen, we maintain:

### III. Third form of relative value: the second form reversed or referred back

*1 coat = 20 yards of linen.*

*u coffee = 20 yards of linen.*

*v tea = 20 yards of linen.*

*x iron = 20 yards of linen.*

*y wheat, etc. = 20 yards of linen.* 

The *relative value-expression* of commodities returns here in its original form: 1 coat = 20 yards of linen. But now this simple equality is further developed. It originally contained only this, that coat-*value* acquires, by its expression in another commodity, *a form distinct from and independent of* *the use value **coat*** or *the coat-body itself*. Now the same form sets the coat over against *all other commodities* as *value* and is therefore its generally valid value-form. Not only the coat, but coffee, iron, wheat, in short, all other commodities, now express their value in the *material **linen***. All present themselves in this way to each other as *the same materialization of human labor*. They now differ only *quantitatively*, which is why 1 coat, u coffee, x iron, etc., i.e., *different quanta* of these different things = 20 yards of linen, i.e. are equal to the *same quantum* of objectified human labor. Through their *communal* expression of value in linen material, each commodity differentiates itself as *exchange value* from its distinctive *use value* and at the same time they all relate to each other as *value magnitudes*, setting themselves as *qualitatively  equal* and comparing (*vergleichen*) themselves quantitatively. It is only in this *unified* relative value-expression that they all *appear* for each other as values, and thus that their value attains its only adequate form of appearance as exchange value. In contrast to the *unfolded* form of relative value (Form II), which presents the [relative] value of a commodity through the ambit of *all the other* commodities [as equivalents], we call this *unitary* value-expression the *general relative value-form*.

In form II: 20 yards of linen = 1 coat or = u coffee or = v tea or = x iron, etc., in which the linen unfolds *its relative value-expression*, it relates itself to each single commodity, coat, coffee, etc., as a *particular equivalent*, and to all of them together as the *ambit of its particular equivalent forms*. In relation to it, no single commodity type is regarded as equivalent simpliciter, as in the singular equivalent, but only as a particular equivalent, any one of which excludes the others. In form III, which is the second form referred back and is thus included in it, the linen appears, by contrast, as the *genus form* (*Gattungsform*) of equivalent for all other commodities. It is as if, in addition to and apart from lions, tigers, hares, and all the other actual animals, which, grouped together, form the different genera, species, subspecies, families, etc., of the animal kingdom, there also existed *the animal*, the individual incarnation of the entire animal kingdom. Such a singular, which encompasses within itself all the actual existing species of the same thing, is a *general*, like *animal*, *god*, etc. Just as linen became a *singular equivalent* through the fact that another commodity related itself to it as a form of appearance of its value, so the linen becomes, as the communal appearance of value for all commodities, *the general equivalent, general body of value, general materialization of abstract human labor.* The *particular* labor materialized in it is therefore now considered as *general form of actualization* of human labor, as *general labor*.

With the presentation of the value of commodity A in commodity B, commodity B became a *singular equivalent*; it was irrelevant what *particular* sort of commodity B was. It was only necessary for the bodiliness of commodity B to be of *another* type than that of commodity A, and therefore also a product of *another useful labor*. By presenting its value in linen, the coat related itself to linen as *the actualized human labor*, and thus to linen-weaving as the *actualization-form of human labor*, but the *particular* determinacy whereby linen-weaving is distinguished from other labor-types was completely irrelevant. It only had to be another labor-type from tailoring and, for the rest, a *determinate* type of labor. Once linen becomes *general equivalent*, it is otherwise. This use value -- in its *particular* determinacy, whereby it is *linen* in distinction from all other commodity types -- coffee, iron, etc. -- now becomes the general value-form of all other commodities and therefore *general equivalent*. The *particular* useful labor-type presented in it therefore now figures as the *general actualization-form of human labor*, as *general* labor, precisely to the extent that it is labor of a particular determinacy, *linen-weaving* in distinction not only from tailoring, but also from coffee growing, mining, and all other types of labor. Conversely, in the *relative value-expression* of the linen, the general equivalent (*Form II*), all other types of labor figure only as *particular forms of actualization* of human labor.

As *values*, commodities *are* expressions of *the same unity*, of abstract human labor. In the form of *exchange value*, they *appear* to each other *as values* and *relate* themselves to each other as values. In so doing, they also relate themselves to abstract human labor as their *common social substance*. Their *social* relation consists exclusively in the fact that they figure for each other as expressions of this their social substance - differing only quantitatively but  qualitatively the same and therefore substitutable for and exchangeable with one another. The commodity as useful thing has social determinacy insofar as it has use value for others than its possessor, and thus meets social needs. But no matter whose needs it meets, it becomes through these useful properties only an *object related to human needs*, not a commodity for *other commodities*. Only through what transforms mere objects of use into commodities can put them into relation with each other *as commodities*  and thus into *social* rapport. But this is what their value is. The form in which they *figure* (*gelten*) as values, as congealed human labor, is therefore their *social form*. For commodities, *social form* and *value form* or *form of exchangeability*, are thus one and the same. If the natural form of a commodity is at the same time its value form, then it has the form of *immediate exchangeability* with other commodities and is therefore *immediately social*.

*The simple relative value-form* (*Form I*) 1 coat = 20 yards of linen differs from the *general relative value-form* 1 coat = 20 yards of linen only in that this equality now forms a link in the series

*1 coat = 20 yards of linen*

*u coffee = 20 yards of linen*

*v tea = 20 yards of linen*

*and so on.*

In fact, then, it differs only in this, that the linen has developed from a *singular* equivalent  into a *general equivalent*. So if in the *simple* relative value-expression it is not the commodity that is expressing its magnitude of value, but the commodity *in which* that magnitude of value is expressed, that receives the *form of immediate exchangeability*, equivalent form, and thus *immediately social form*, then the same applies to the general relative value-expression. But in the simple relative value form this difference is only formal and fleeting. If in the equality '1 coat = 20 yards linen', the coat expresses its value relatively, i.e. in linen, and the linen thereby receives equivalent form, still this same equality immediately includes the relation back: 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, in which the coat receives the equivalent form and the value of the linen is relatively expressed. But now this uniform and mutual development of the value-form of both commodities as relative and equivalent value no longer holds. If the general relative value-form 1 coat = 20 yards of linen, where the linen is *general equivalent*, is reversed into 20 yards of linen = 1 coat, then the coat does not thereby become a general equivalent for all other commodities, but only a particular equivalent of the linen. The relative value-form of the coat is only *general* because it is at the same time the relative value-form of all other commodities. What is true of the coat is true of coffee, etc. It follows, therefore, that the general relative value-form of commodities *excludes* them from the general equivalent form. Conversely, a commodity such as linen, as soon as it has the general equivalent form, is excluded from the general relative value-form. The general relative value-form of linen, unified with the other commodities, would be: 20 yards of linen = 20 yards of linen. But this is a tautology, and does not express the *value magnitude* of the commodity in its general equivalent form, nor therefore in its always-exchangeable form. Now, instead, the relative value-expression *specific* to the general equivalent is the *unfolded relative* value-form: 20 yards linen = 1 coat *or* = u coffee or = v tea *or* = u, *etc*.

In the general relative value-expression of commodities, each commodity, coat, coffee, tea, etc., possesses a *value-form* distinct from its natural-form, namely the form **linen**. And it is in this form that they relate to each other precisely as exchangeable things and as things exchangeable in quantitatively determined proportions, for if 1 coat = 20 yards of linen, x coffee = 20 yards of linen, etc., then 1 coat = x coffee, etc. In that all commodities reflect themselves in one and the same commodity as magnitudes of value, they reciprocally reflect each other as magnitudes of value. But the natural forms they have as objects of use do not figure as forms of appearance of value for them directly, but only by this indirection. They are not immediately exchangeable, not as they are immediately. They do not possess the *form of immediate exchangeability* with each other; or, their *socially valid form* is a *mediated* one. Conversely: by all other commodities relating themselves to linen as a form of appearance of value, the natural form of linen becomes the form of *its immediate exchangeability* with all commodities, and thus *immediately* its *general social* form.

A commodity only receives the *general equivalent  form* because and to the extent that it serves, for all other commodities, as a presentation of their *general relative*, and thus *non-immediate*, form of value. Commodities in general must give themselves a relative form of value because their natural forms are merely their use-value forms; and they must give themselves a unitary, and thus general, relative form of value in order to relate to each other as values, as homogeneous congelations of human labor. *A single* commodity finds itself in the form of immediate exchangeability with all other commodities and so in immediately social form  only because and to the extent that *all other commodities* are *not* in this form - or because the commodity in general is by default *not* in immediately exchangeable or social form, its immediate form being the form of its use value, not of its value.

One cannot tell from looking that the form *general immediate exchangeability* is in fact an *antithetical* commodity form, as inseparable from the form of *non-immediate* exchangeability as the positivity of one magnetic pole is from the negativity of the other. So one can imagine it possible to imprint upon all commodities the stamp of immediate exchangeability, just as one can imagine it possible to make all workers into *capitalists*. In fact, however, *general relative value-form* and *general equivalent form* are the antithetical poles of the *same* social form of commodities - poles which reciprocally presuppose and repel each other .[^a23]

Linen, the general equivalent, as *immediately social materialization (Materiatur) of labor*, is *materialization of immediately social labor*, while the other commodity-bodies, those that present their value in linen, are materializations of *non-immediately social* labor.

In fact, all use values are commodities only as *products of private labors that are independent of each other* -- private labors which, as particular, though independent, members of the spontaneous system of  *division of labor*, are materially dependent on each other. The labors thus hang together socially precisely through their *difference*, their particular *usefulness*. Precisely for this reason they produce qualitatively different use values. 

If not, these use values would not become commodities for each other. On the other hand, this different useful quality   does not make products into commodities. If a peasant family produces coats and linen and wheat for their own consumption, these things confront the family as different products of their family labor, but do not confront themselves reciprocally as commodities. If labor were *immediately social*, i.e., communal labor, the products would acquire the immediately social character of a common product for their producers, but not the character of commodities for each other. But we do not need to look far to find what the *social form* consists in for the reciprocally independent *private labors* contained in commodities. It has already emerged from the analysis of the commodity. Their social form is their relating to each other as *equal labor*, thus -- since the equality of labors that differ *toto coelo* can only consist in an *abstraction from their inequality* -- their relating to each other as *human labor* in general, as *expenditures of human labor-power*, as something  which all human labors, whatever their content and mode of operation, in fact *are*. 

In every social form of labor, the labors of different individuals are related to each other as human labor too, but here this *relation itself* figures as the *specifically social form* of labor. But none of these private labors in its natural form possesses this specifically social form of abstract human labor -- no more than the commodity, in its natural form, possesses the social form of mere congealed human labor, or of value. But because the natural form of one commodity, in this case linen, comes to be general equivalent form, in that all other commodities relate to it as the form of appearance of their own value, so also linen-weaving becomes the general form of actualization of abstract human labor, or labor in immediately social form. The standard of "socialness" must be borrowed from the nature of the relations proper to each mode of production, not from representations foreign to it. As was shown earlier, the commodity by nature excludes the immediate form of general exchangeability and can therefore only develop the general equivalent form in opposition to it; the same applies to the private labor inherent in commodities. Since they are *not immediately social labor*, the *social form* is, first of all, a form distinct from the natural form of the actual useful labor, a form foreign to them and abstract, and secondly, all types of private labor maintain their social character only in opposition, in that they are all equated with an exclusive type of private labor, here, linen-weaving. This makes the latter the immediate and general form of appearance of abstract human labor and thus labor in an immediately social form. It therefore also presents itself immediately in a socially valid and generally exchangeable product.

The semblance that the equivalent form of a commodity arises from its own material nature, instead of being a mere reflection of the relations of the other commodities, is reinforced with the development of the singular equivalent into the general equivalent, because the opposing moments of the value form no longer develop uniformly for the commodities related to each other, because the general equivalent form distinguishes a commodity as something quite apart from all other commodities, and finally because this form is no longer the product of the relation of any single other commodity.

However, from our present point of view, the general equivalent is by no means ossified. How was linen transformed into the general equivalent? By relatively presenting its value in a single commodity (form I), then in all other commodities in turn (form II), and thus relatively presenting all other commodities in it (form III). The simple relative value-expression was the germ from which the general equivalent form of the linen developed. Within this development, it changes its role. It begins by presenting its value magnitude in another commodity and ends up serving as the material for the value-expression of all other commodities. What is true of the linen is true of every commodity. In its unfolded relative value-expression (Form II), which consists only of its many simple value-expressions, the linen does not yet figure as a general equivalent. Rather, every other commodity-body forms its equivalent here, is therefore immediately exchangeable with it, and can thus change places with it.

We therefore ultimately maintain:

### Form IV:

20 yards of linen = 1 coat or = u coffee or = v tea or = x iron or = y wheat or = u. s. w.

1 coat = 20 yards of linen or = u coffee or = v tea or = x iron or = y wheat or = u. s. w.

u Coffee = 20 yards of linen or = 1 coat or = v Tea or = x Iron or = y Wheat or = u. s. w.

v Tea = u. s. w.

But each of these equalities, when referred back, shows that coat, coffee, tea, etc., are general equivalents, and therefore the value-expression in coat, coffee, tea, etc., is the general relative value-form of all other commodities. The general equivalent form belongs only to one commodity in opposition to all other commodities; but it belongs to each commodity in opposition to all others. But if each commodity sets its own natural-form in opposition to all other commodities as general equivalent-form, then all commodities exclude all from the general equivalent-form and therefore exclude themselves from the socially valid presentation of their values.

It can be seen that the analysis of the commodity reveals all the essential determinations of the value-form and the value-form itself in its opposing moments: the general relative value-form, the general equivalent form, and finally the never-ending series of simple relative value-expressions, which forms only a transitional phase in the development of the value-form, only to finally change into the specifically relative value-form of the general equivalent. But the analysis of the commodity showed these forms as forms of commodity in general, which therefore also belong to every commodity, only in opposition, so that when commodity A is in one formal determination, commodities B, C, etc., assume the other in relation to it. But the decisive thing was to discover the necessary inner connection between the value-form, the value-substance and the value-quantity, i.e., expressed in idealistic terms, to prove that the value-form arises from the concept of value.

At first glance, a commodity appears to be a trivial thing, a matter of course. Its analysis shows that it is a very complicated thing, full of metaphysical subtleties and theological quirks. As mere use value, it is a sensuous thing, and there is nothing mysterious about it, whether I look at it from the point of view that its properties satisfy human needs or that it only acquires these properties as a product of human labor. There is absolutely nothing mysterious about the fact that human beings, through their activity, change the forms of natural substances in a way that is useful to them. The form of wood, for example, is changed when it is made into a table. Nevertheless, the table remains wood, an ordinary sensuous thing. But as soon as it appears as a commodity, it is transformed into a sensuous, supersensuous thing. It not only stands with its feet on the ground, but, compared to all other commodities, it turns upside down and develops quirks from its wooden head, much more whimsical than if it began to dance of its own free will.[^a25]

The mystical character of the commodity does not, therefore, arise from its use value. It arises just as little from the determinations of value, considered in themselves. For, firstly, however different useful labors or productive activities may be, it is a physiological truth that they are functions of a specifically human organism, in contrast to other organisms, and that each such function, whatever its content and form, is essentially the expenditure of human brain, nerve, muscle, sense organ, etc. As for the basis for determining the value, the length of time of that expenditure or the quantity of labor, the quantity can even be clearly distinguished from the quality of the labor. In all conditions, the labor time required to produce the means of life must interest human beings, although not equally at different levels of development. Finally, as soon as human beings work for each other in any way, their labor also takes on a social form.

Take Robinson Crusoe on his island. Modest as he is by nature, he still has different types of needs to satisfy and must therefore perform useful labor of various kinds: make tools, fabricate furniture, tame llamas, fish, hunt, etc. We will not speak of praying and the like here, since our Robinson finds pleasure in it and regards such activity as recreation. Despite the diversity of his productive functions, he knows that they are only different forms of activity for the same Robinson, and thus only different modes of human labor. Necessity itself forces him to distribute his time precisely between his various functions. Whether one or the other takes up more or less space in his total activity depends on the greater or lesser difficulty that must be overcome to achieve the desired effect. Experience teaches him this, and our Robinson, who saved the clock, ledger, ink and quill from the shipwreck, soon begins, as a good Englishman, to keep records about himself. His inventory contains a list of the objects of use he possesses, the various processes required for their production, and finally the labor time that certain quantities of these various products cost him on average. All the relationships between Robinson and the things that form his self-made wealth are so simple and transparent here that even Mr. M. Wirth might understand them without any particular mental effort. And yet all the essential determinations of value are contained in it.

If we now replace Robinson with an association of free human beings who work with common means of production and expend their many individual labor-powers self-consciously as one social labor-power. All the determinations of Robinson's labor are repeated, only socially instead of individually. However, one essential difference arises. All of Robinson's products were exclusively his personal product and therefore immediate objects of use for him. The collective product of the association is a social product. Part of this product serves as a means of production again. It remains social. But another part is consumed as a means of life by the members of the association. It must therefore be distributed among them. The nature of this distribution will change with the particular nature of the social production organism itself and the corresponding historical level of development of the producers. It is only for the sake of parallelism with commodity production that we posit that each producer's share of the means of life is determined by his labor time. Thus labor time would play a dual role. Its distribution according to a social plan regulates the proper proportion of the various labor functions to the various needs. On the other hand, labor time also serves as a measure of the individual producer's share of the common labor and thus also of the individually consumable part of the common product. The social relationships of human beings to their labor and their labor products remain transparently simple here, in both production and distribution.

Where, then, does the enigmatic character of the labor product come from as soon as it takes on the form of a commodity?

When human beings relate their products to each other as values, insofar as these things, mere factual shells, are considered to be of the same kind as human labor, it is also the case that their different labors are only considered to be the same kind of human labor in a factual shell. They relate their different labors to each other as human labor by relating their products to each other as values. The personal relationship is hidden by the objective form. Therefore, value is not written on the forehead, as it were, of things as what they are. In order to relate their products to each other as commodities, human beings are forced to equate their various labor-products abstractly with human labor. They do not know this, but they do so by reducing the material thing to the abstraction of value. This is a natural and therefore unconscious and instinctive operation of their brain, which necessarily arises from the particular way in which they produce material and the conditions in which this production places them. At first, their relation is there practically. But secondly, because they are human beings, their relation exists for them as relation. The way in which it exists for them, or is reflected in their brain, arises from the nature of the relation itself. Later on they seek to penetrate the secret of their own social product by means of science, for the determination of a thing as value is their product, as much as language. As for the magnitude of value, the private labors that are carried out independently of one another but, as members of the natural division of labor, are interdependent in every way, are continually reduced to their socially proportional measure by the fact that the haphazard and ever-fluctuating exchange relationships of their products, the socially necessary labor time for their production is forcibly established as a regulating natural law, like the law of gravity, for example, when the house above your head collapses.[^a26]

The determination of the value through labor time is therefore a hidden secret among the apparent movements of the relative value of commodities. The producers' own social movement takes on the form of a movement of things over which they are controlled, instead of their controlling them. As for the value-form, it is precisely this form that objectively obscures the social relations of the private laborers and thus the social determinacy of their private labor, instead of revealing it. When I say that a coat, boots, etc. are related to linen as the general materialization of abstract human labor, the absurdity of this expression is immediately apparent. But when the producers of coats, boots, etc., relate these commodities to linen as a general equivalent, the social relation of their private labors appears to them precisely in this crazy form.

Such forms form the categories of bourgeois economics. They are socially valid, and thus objective, thought forms for the relations of production of this historically determined social mode of production.

Private producers only come into social contact through their private products, their things. The social relations of their labor are and appear not as immediately social relations of the persons in their labor, but as objective relations of the persons or social relations of the things. The first and most general “presentation” of a thing as a social thing, however, is the transformation of the labor product into a commodity.

The mysticism of the commodity arises from the fact that the private producers do not see the social determinations of their private labor as social determinations of the products of labor, that the social relations of production of persons appear as social relations of things to each other and to persons. The relations of the private workers to the overall social labor objectify themselves in relation to them and therefore exist for them in the forms of objects. For a society of commodity producers whose general social production relation consists in relating to their products as commodities, that is, as values, and in this objective form relating their private labors to each other as equal human labor, Christianity, with its cult of the abstract human being, especially in its bourgeois development, Protestantism, deism, etc., is the most appropriate form of religion. In the modes of production of ancient Asia, ancient Greece, etc., the transformation of the product into a commodity, and therefore the existence of human beings as commodity producers, plays a subordinate role, but one that becomes more significant the more the communities enter into the stage of their decline. Real commercial peoples only exist in the interstices of the ancient world, like Epicurus' gods, or like Jews in the pores of Polish society. Those old social production organisms are extraordinarily much simpler and more transparent than the bourgeois one, but they are based either on the immaturity of the individual human being, who has not yet broken away from the umbilical cord of the natural connection of the species with others, or on immediate relationships of domination and servitude. They are caused by a low level of development of the productive forces of labor and correspondingly constrained relations of human beings within their material process of producing life, and thus to each other and to nature. This actual constraint is reflected in the old nature and folk religions. The religious reflection of the real world can only disappear as soon as the conditions of practical everyday life present humans with transparently reasonable relations to each other and to nature. But these relations can only present themselves as what they are. The form of the social process of life, i.e., the material process of production, only removes its mystical veil of mist as soon as it stands as a product of freely associated human beings under their conscious, planned control. For this, however, a material basis of society is required, or a series of material conditions of existence, which themselves are the natural product of a long and tortuous history of development.

Political economy has now analyzed, albeit imperfectly,[^a27] the value and the magnitude of value. It has never even asked the question why labor is presented in the value and the measure of labor in the magnitude of value through its duration? Forms that have it written all over them that they belong to a social formation in which the production process masters human beings, in which human beings have not yet mastered the production process, are considered by their bourgeois consciousness to be just as much a natural necessity as productive labor itself. Pre-bourgeois forms of the social organism of production are therefore treated by it as pre-Christian religions are treated by the church fathers.[^a28]

The extent to which some economists are deceived by the fetishism clinging to the world of commodities or by the objective semblance of the social determinations of labor is demonstrated, among other things, by the boring, tasteless quarrel over the role of nature in the formation of exchange value. Since exchange value is a determined social manner of expressing the labor related to a thing, it cannot contain more natural material than, say, the exchange rate.

As the most general and undeveloped form of bourgeois production, which therefore appears in earlier production periods, although not in the same dominant, characteristic way, the commodity form was still relatively easy to understand. But more concrete forms, such as capital, for example? The fetishism of classical economics becomes palpable here.

However, in order not to anticipate, one more example regarding the commodity form itself will suffice here. It has been seen that in the relationship of commodity to commodity, e.g. of boot to boot jack, the use value of the boot jack, that is, the usefulness of its actual material properties, is completely indifferent to the boot. The boot jack is only interested in the boot material as a form of appearance of its own value. If commodities could speak, they would say, 'Our use value may interest human beings. It does not come to us as a thing. But what comes to us as a thing is our value. Our own intercourse as commodity-things proves this. We relate to each other only as exchange values. Now listen to how the economist speaks from the soul of a commodity: 

“Value (exchange value) is a property of things, wealth (use value) of human beings. Value in this sense necessarily includes exchange, wealth does not.” [^a29]

“Wealth (use value) is an attribute of human beings, value is an attribute of commodities. A human being or a community is rich; a pearl or a diamond is valuable... A pearl or a diamond has value as a pearl or a diamond.”  [^a30]

So far, no chemist has discovered exchange value in pearls or diamonds. Our writers, who make particular claims to critical depth, do find, however, that the use value of things comes to them independently of their material properties, whereas their exchange value comes to them as things. What confirms them in this is the strange circumstance that the use value of things is realized for human beings without exchange, that is, in the immediate relationship between thing and human being, whereas their value is realized only in exchange, that is, in a social process. Who does not remember here the good Dogberry, who instructs the night watchman Seacoal: “Being a good-looking man is a gift of circumstances, but being able to read and write comes from nature [^a31]”.

The commodity is an immediate unity of use value and exchange value, i.e., of two opposites. It is therefore an immediate contradiction. This contradiction must develop as soon as it is actually related to other commodities as a whole, not, as before, analytically, sometimes from the point of view of use value, sometimes from the point of view of exchange value. The actual relationship between commodities, however, is their exchange process.

[^a15]:   The reader must note that we do not here speak of the *wages* or value that the worker receives for (e.g.) a day's labour, but of the *commodity value* in which his day of labour is objectified. The category of wages does not exist at all at this level (*Stufe*) of our presentation.

[^a16]:   It is, as it were, the cell form of money, or, as Hegel would say, the *in itself of money* (das *An sich des Geldes*).

[^a17]:   The few economists who, like J. Bailey, have occupied themselves with the analysis of the value-form, could not arrive at any result, first, because they confuse the value-form and value, and, secondly, because, under the crude influence of the practical bourgeois, they focus from the outset exclusively on the quantitative determination. "The command of *quantity*.... constitutes *value*." (*Money and its Vicissitudes.* London 1837, p. 11.) Author: J. Bailey.

[^a18]:    One thus speaks of the coatvalue of linen when one speaks of its value in coats, of its grainvalue when one presents it in grain, etc. Each such expression indicates that it is its value that appears in the use values of coats, grain, etc.

[^a18a]:   In a certain respect, it is with the human being as it is with the commodity. Since the human being neither comes into the world with a mirror nor as a Fichtean philosopher: "I am I", he is initially only reflected in another human being. It is only through relating to the human Paul as his equal that the human Peter relates to himself as a human being. But with that, Paul also figures for Peter, with skin and hair, in his Pauline bodiliness, as form of appearance of the genus *human*.

[^a19]:   “The concept, which is at first only subjective, proceeds, in accordance with its own activity, without the need for external material or stuff, to objectify itself.” Hegel, Encyclopedia *Logic* §194, first *Zusatz*.

[^a19a]:   In so far as the preparation of the polish itself is popularly called polishing. 

[^a20]:   It is hardly surprising that the economists, wholly under the influence of material interests, overlooked the formal content of the relative value-expression, when, before *Hegel*, even logicians by profession overlooked the formal content of the paradigms of judgment and inference.

[^a21]:   It is with such determinations of reflection generally a distinctive thing. This human being, for example, is only king because other human beings relate to him as subjects. They conversely believe themselves to be subjects because he is king.

[^a22]:   "The value of any commodity denoting its relation in exchange, we may speak of it as.... cornvalue, cloth value, according to the commodity with which it is compared; and then there are a *thousand different kinds of value*, as many kinds of value as there are commodities in existence, and all are equally real and equally nominal." (*A Critical Dissertation on the Nature, Measure and Causes of Value*: "chiefly in reference to the writings of Mr. Ricardo and his followers. By the Author of Essays on the Formation etc. of Opinions." London 1825, p. 39). S. Bailey, the author of this anonymous text, which caused quite a stir in England at the time, imagines that by this reference to the motley relative *expressions* of the same commodity *value*, he has destroyed any conceptual determination of value. Despite his own narrow-mindedness, that he had probed the sore spots in Ricardo's theory was proved by the irritation with which the Ricardo school attacked him, for example in the Westminster Review.

[^a23]:   For the small bourgeois, who sees in the form of commodity production the *ne plus ultra* of human freedom and individual independence, it would, of course, be highly desirable to be relieved at the same time of the *abuses* bound up with this form, including in particular the *non-immediate* exchangeability of commodities. The description of this philistine utopia forms Proudhon's socialism, which, as I have shown elsewhere, does not even have the merit of originality, but was developed much better long before him by Bray, Gray and others. This does not prevent such wisdom from running rampant in France today under the name of “science”. No school has thrown the word “science” around more than Proudhon's, for “where concepts are lacking, a word presents itself at the right time.”

[^a24] It is one of the fundamental defects of classical political economy that it never succeeded in finding out from the analysis of the commodity and especially commodity *value* the *form* of value that makes it an *exchange value*. Especially in its best representatives, such as A. Smith and Ricardo, it treats the value-*form* as something quite indifferent or external to the nature of the commodity itself. The reason for this is not only that their attention is absorbed entirely by the analysis of the *magnitude of value*. It lies deeper. The *value-form of the product of labor* is the most abstract, but also the most general *form* of the *bourgeois* mode of production, which is thereby characterized as a *particular* type of *social* mode of production and, at the same time, characterized *historically*. If one therefore takes it for the eternal natural form of social production, then one also necessarily overlooks the specificity of the value-*form*, and thus the *commodity*-form, which are more highly developed in the *money*-form, *capital*-form, etc. One therefore finds among economists, who absolutely agree on the measure of the value magnitude through labor time, the most motley and contradictory representations of *money*, i.e., the finished form of the general equivalent. This becomes strikingly evident, for example, in the treatment of banking, where the commonplace definitions of money are no longer sufficient. In opposition to this, a *restored mercantile system* arose (Ganilh, etc.), which sees in value only the *social form*, or rather only its semblance without substance. To make it clear once and for all, by *classical political economy* I understand all economy that, since W. Petty, investigates the inner nexus (*Zusammenhang*) of bourgeois relations of production, in opposition to *vulgar economy*, which moves around the *seeming* nexus only in order to give a plausible rationalization for what are called the crudest phenomena -- constantly regurgitating, for bourgeois domestic needs, material long since supplied by scientific economy -- and which, for the rest, limits itself to pedantically systematizing, and proclaiming as eternal truths, the banal and complacent representations of the bourgeois agents  production about their own, the best, world.

[^a26]:   “What are we to think of a law that can only be enforced by periodic revolutions? It is precisely a law of nature that is based on the unconsciousness of those affected.” (Friedrich Engels: “Outlines of a Critique of Political Economy”, p. 103 in “Franco-German Annuals, edited by Arnold Ruge and Karl Marx. Paris 1849.”)

[^a27]:   The inadequacies of Ricardo's analysis of the magnitude of value – and they are the best – can be seen in the third and fourth books of this text. But as far as value in general is concerned, classical political economy nowhere explicitly and with clear consciousness distinguishes labor that is presented in value from the same labor insofar as it is presented in the use value of its product. Of course, it actually makes the distinction, since it regards labor in terms of quantity on the one hand and in terms of quality on the other. But it does not occur to it that the mere quantitative difference of the labors presupposes their qualitative unity or equality, that is, their reduction to abstract human labor. Ricardo, for example, agrees with Destutt de Tracy when he says: “As it is certain that our physical and moral faculties are alone our original riches, the employment of those faculties, labor of some kind, is our original treasure, and that it is always from this employment — that all those things are created which we call riches... It is certain too, that all those things only represent the labor which has created them, and if they have a value, or even two distinct values, they can only derive them from that (the value) of the labor from which they emanate.” (Ricardo: ‘The Principles of Pol. Econ. 3 ed. Lond. 1821’, p. 334). We only hint that Ricardo attributes his own deeper meaning to Destutt. On the one hand, Destutt does indeed say that all the things that form wealth “represent the labor that created them,” but on the other hand, that they maintain their “two different values” (use value and exchange value) from the “value of labor.” He thus falls into the shallowness of vulgar economics, which presupposes the value of a commodity (here labor) in order to determine the value of the other commodities. Ricardo reads it in such a way that labor (not the value of labor) is presented both in use value and exchange value. But he himself fails to distinguish the dual character of labor, which is presented in two ways, so that in the whole chapter, “Value and Riches, Their Distinctive Properties,” he has to laboriously deal with the trivialities of a J. B. Say. In the end, he is quite astonished that Destutt, on the one hand, agrees with him about labor as a source of value, but on the other hand, harmonizes with Say about the concept of value

[^a28]:   “Les économistes ont une singulière manière de procéder. Il n'y a pour eux que deux sortes d'institution, celles de l'art et celles de la nature. Les institutions de la féodalité sont des institutions artificielles, celles de la bourgeoisie sont des institutions naturelles. In this they resemble theologians, who also establish two types of religion. All religion that is not theirs is an invention of men, whereas their own religion is an emanation of God. Thus there was history, but there is no longer any.” (Karl Marx: “Misère de la Philosophie. Response to the Philosophy of Misery by Mr. Proudhon. 1847), p. 113.) Mr. Bastiat is truly droll when he imagines that the ancient Greeks and Romans lived only by robbery. But if you live by robbery for many centuries, there must always be something to rob or the object of robbery must constantly reproduce itself. It would therefore appear that the Greeks and Romans also had a production process, and thus an economy, which formed the material basis of their world, just as bourgeois economics does for today's world. Or does Bastiat mean that a mode of production based on slave labor rests on a system of robbery? If so, he is treading on dangerous ground. If a giant of thought like Aristotle erred in his appreciation of slave labor, why should a dwarf economist like Bastiat be right in his appreciation of wage labor? I take this opportunity to briefly dismiss an objection that was raised against me when my text “Zur Kritik der Pol. Oekonomie. 1859” was made by a German-American paper. It said that my view that the determinate mode of production and the relations of production corresponding to it in each case, in short, ‘the economic structure of society is the real basis on which a legal and political superstructure rises, and to which certain social forms of consciousness correspond,’ that ”the mode of production of material life conditions the social, political and spiritual process of life in general” - all this is true for today's world, where material interests, but not for the Middle Ages, where Catholicism, and for Athens and Rome, where politics ruled. First of all, it is strange that someone should assume that these world-famous sayings about the Middle Ages and the ancient world are unknown to anyone. It is clear that the Middle Ages could not live on Catholicism and the ancient world could not live on politics. Conversely, the way they gained their livelihood explains why politics played its role there and Catholicism here. Incidentally, it takes little acquaintance with the history of the Roman Republic, for example, to know that the history of land ownership forms its secret history. On the other hand, Don Quixote already made the mistake of thinking that the traveling knighthood was on equal terms with all economic forms of society.

He has reduced the semblance of relativity which these things, diamond and pearls, for example, possess as exchange values, to the true relation hidden behind the semblance, to their relativity as mere expressions of human labor. If the Ricardians answered Bailey roughly, but not refutably, it was only because they did not find any explanation in Ricardo himself of the inner connection between value and exchange value.
